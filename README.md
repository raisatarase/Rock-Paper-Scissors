# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game created for personal training and learning purposes.

## About

This project implements the classic Rock Paper Scissors game using JavaScript. Players can choose between rock, paper, and scissors, and play against the computer. The game will run for five rounds, and the results of each round will be displayed in the console.

## Getting Started

To run the game, simply open the HTML file in a web browser. Follow the on-screen instructions to make your choices and play the game.

## Motivation

I created this project as a part of my personal training in JavaScript programming. It allowed me to practice essential programming concepts and logic while building a fun and interactive game.

## Contributing

As this is a personal training project, I'm not actively looking for contributions. However, feel free to fork the repository if you'd like to experiment with the code or suggest improvements.
